4. Take the resulting array from that and paste that into `localscripts/saveurls.py` as `urls`
5. Run `localscripts/saveurls.py`, which will save all the pictures locally
6. Upload these to an imgur album
7. Use `localscripts/deleteMiiverse.js` as needed to clear up space of your now-backed up miiverse
